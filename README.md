### Generate a secret token

In order to ensure that webhooks are originating from your EbicsBox and have not been modified, we
sign each webhook with a predefined secret. Each box should have a unique secret key. In order to
generate one, you can use the following command:

```bash
  ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(32)'
```

## Usage

see [docs.ebicsbox.apiary.io](http://docs.ebicsbox.apiary.io)

### Tests

We are using RSpec to test this project. In order to execute all specs once, run `bundle exec rspec`.

To migrate your test database run the following command:

```bash
  $ ENVIRONMENT=test bundle exec bin/migrate
```

### Error Tracking

The ebicsbox enables sentry as the error tracking software of choice. Simply define `SENTRY_DSN` via an environment
variable to enable error tracking in production mode

### Documentation

Our goal is to provide an always up-to-date documentation from within the app.

Documentation is available at http://YOUR-HOST/docs

> v1 docs are not maintained anymore and are just available as static swagger file
