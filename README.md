# Epics::Box

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/railslove/epics-box.svg?token=AM3M96RpNyP5z4TXrjkp&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/railslove/epics-box)

Epics Box is a selfcontained solution to handle SEPA credit/debits and bank statement
reconcilliation.

It offers a HTTP interface and can be integrated with different message queueing systems

## Getting started

    $ createdb ebicsbox
    $ sequel -m migrations postgres://localhost/ebicsbox

## Prerequistes

* ruby (jruby / ruby 2.2.x)
* beanstalkd
* postgres
* webpack (npm install webpack -g)

## Development

Run it:

    $ forman start -f Procfile.dev

If this is too noisy, you can prefix the command with ```RUBYOPT="-W0"``` which removes warnings
raised by jruby and beaneater about uninitialized variables.

Furthermore, we recommend using ```JRUBY_OPTS="$JRUBY_OPTS --dev"``` which speeds up jruby quite a
bit. Check https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Improving-startup-time for more infomation about it.

## Installation

Run it:

    $ foreman start

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

* DATABASE_URL
* BEANSTALKD_URL
* PASSPHRASE

you can store these in a local .env file for development.

Is done via environment variables. You can utilize a `.env` file while
developing locally. Please revise `.env.example` for a overview
of needed parameters.

### Generate a secret token

In order to ensure that webhooks are originating from your EbicsBox and have not been modified, we
sign each webhook with a predefined secret. Each box should have a unique secret key. In order to
generate one, you can use the following command:

```bash
  ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'
```

## Usage

see [docs.ebicsbox.apiary.io](http://docs.ebicsbox.apiary.io)

### Tests

We are using RSpec to test this project. In order to execute all specs once, run ```bundle exec rspec```.
If you are actively developing, you can execute specs automatically by running guard with ```bundle exec guard```.

### Documentation

Our goal is to provide an always up-to-date documentation from within the app. In order to achieve
this, we have rake tasks which extract inline documentation and generate swagger formatted files
which again can be used to auto-generate a UI.

To update the existing documentation run ```bin/update_docs``` from the root of the project.
It will update the existing documentation with changes from the project.

Documentation is available at http://YOUR-HOST/docs
